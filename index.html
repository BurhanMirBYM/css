    <p class="text"> <span style="color:red ;">~Mercedes-Benz AMG GT 53 :-</span><br>
        1:   A DRIVE EXPERIENCE THAT KNOCKS YOUR SOCKS OFF:<br>
        The AMG GT 53’s 429 horsepower/384 torque will do that, especially in sport mode. Learn to use the paddle shifters, learn to enjoy the rumble and thrill of a powerful gas engine because these are fleeting; they will become rare beasts in many places in the not-to-distant future <br> 
         2: AN EXTERIOR DESIGN THAT MAKES YOU FALL IN LOVE:<br> 
        Every time you look at it. I was immediately smitten by the elegant sweep of the roof line of the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT 53. I love it with the spoiler extended and also, with it retracted. I loved that I could have it both ways. I also loved the color of the test model: White with black accents. So chic <br>
        3:   . A SUEDE STEERING WHEEL:<br>
        This will change your life. Seriously. It’s like holding your favorite boots in your hands and then guiding a rocket ship with them. Suede is a powerful material. It gives you unyielding grip and control and yet feels so soothingly luxe. You’re reminded every time you grab the wheel that this is car is the best of the best  <br>
        4:     HEAD UP DISPLAY AND BUILT-IN NAVIGATION :<br>
        Until HUD systems are built to connect with the maps on your phone (it’s coming but not here yet on most vehicles) you’ll need the car’s own navigation system in order to have turn by turn directions displayed on the HUD. It’s worth it. This combination is priceless.</p>

    <p class="text" > <span style="color: green;">:~BUGATTI CHIRON</span> <br>
        All Chiron models are motivated by an 8.0-liter 16-cylinder powerplant. This beast of an engine employs four turbochargers to generate a mighty 1500 horsepower and 1180 pound-feet of torque. Bugatti claims that the Chiron makes the dash from zero to 60 mph in a mere 2.3 seconds, and it has a top speed of 261 mph. If the Chiron's standard engine doesn't quench your thirst for speed, step up to the Chiron Super Sport. This model is equipped with a slightly more potent version of the base powerplant, and it produces 1578 horsepower. At our test track, the Super Sport got to 60 mph in just 2.2 seconds and, amazingly, hit 200 mph in under 15 seconds. Piloted by factory test driver Andy Wallace, a model with specs almost identical to those of the Chiron Super Sport logged a record-setting 304.773 mph test-track run. With every model in the Chiron lineup, power is sent to all four wheels by a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.<br>
       : Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG;<br>
As one would expect from a car with a 1500-hp engine, the Chiron won't win any points for being eco-friendly. According to the EPA, the Chiron achieves mileage (we hesitate to use the words "fuel economy") of up to 9 mpg city and 14 mpg highway. The Pur Sport and Super Sport models are rated for 8 mpg city and 11 highway. We haven't run the Chiron on our 75-mph highway fuel-economy route, which is part of our extensive testing regimen, so we can't evaluate its real-world mpg<br>\
:Interior, Comfort, and Cargo;<br>
The Chiron's exterior features a C-shaped design cue carved into its side panels, and this element is also present within the car's cabin. It's reflected in the graceful curve of a partition that separates driver and passenger. Bugatti has dressed the Chiron's cabin in top-of-the-line materials, and the interior bears space-age styling elements that add whimsical charm. A flat-bottomed steering wheel greets the driver, and Bugatti claims the glossy center console is made from a single piece of solid aluminum. With the Chiron, it's best to pack light. The trunk provides just two cubic feet of cargo space<br>
:Warranty and Maintenance Coverage;<br>
Bugatti offers a four-year warranty on all Chiron models and covers maintenance for the vehicle over the same time period.<br>
    1:Limited warranty covers four years<br>
   2: Powertrain warranty covers four years<br>
    3:Complimentary scheduled maintenance for four years<br>
